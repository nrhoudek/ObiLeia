			<h1>Nick</h1>
			<p>Meet Nick! Nick is 23 years old and graduated from The University of Arizona in 2019. He doubled majored in Criminal Justice Studies and Public Policy and Management. Nick also has an Associates of Science in Science with a concentration in Computer Science.
			Nick has always had in interest in technology and computers, and is usually scheming his way to obtaining the 'next big thing' in the tech world. He has built and installed many computers, written a plethora of Java, C++, and C# programs, but has yet to step into the world
			of web design and let his (VERY limited) creativity run free. This website is his first step. However, when Nick isn't working on this website or exchanging choice words with Obi and Leia for laying on his keyboards, he is usually tinkering with his PC, playing video games
			with his friends, or doing some type of activity with his fianc√©. Aside from his near crippling addiction to Diet Coke and Mechanical Keyboards, Nick lives a mostly healthy lifestyle so he can spend as much time with his family, friends, and cats, as possible.</p>

		  <h1>Katie</h1>
			<p>Meet Katie! Katie is 25 years old and graduated from The University of Arizona in 2020. She majored in Biochemistry and has two Associates of Science Degrees: Associates of Clinical Research and an Associates of Science. Katie has always had a creative itch that needs to be scratched.
			From drawing and painting to interior designing, Katie has already had an interest and appreciation for art. Recently, she has stepped into the world of photography, and with her camera in hand, she is ready to shoot something. While she is learning the ropes to photography,
			she has been using her cats as practice since they are so photogenic, but also mainly because they are, well, close. Outside of cat photos, Katie loves to hike, and her new-found hobby, fortunately, pairs up perfectly. Between nature, and the ecosystem of a small apartment,
			Katie has plenty of opportunity to take those shots that makes something like this site possible.</p>
