    <p style="text-align: center"><b>Hi! Welcome to ObiLeia, the wildest, most mediocre, and uninspiring website you will ever come across.</b></p>

    <p>For those of you who are going to waste precious minutes of your life browsing this website, allow me to explain the reasoning for this <i>work of art</i>. My name is Nick, and I am currently attempting to teach myself web design and development through HTML, Javascript, CSS, and so on. So, what better way than to dive right in?
    This will be my first ever attempt at designing a website from scratch and I am super excited to fail miserably. In addition to my desire to learn web development, my fianc√©, Katie, has recently gotten into the hobby of photography, and has already amassed enough photos of our cats that they are currently working on a restraining order against her.
    Since there is nothing manlier than being a cat-dad and a web designer, I figured what better way to start my portfolio than showing you I have nothing better in my life than my cats. Besides, what's the point of taking photos if you're not going to shove them into someone's face?
    If you know someone whose life is as lonely as mine is, someone who loves cats just a bit 'too' much, or somone who loves to critique either web design or photography then you should probably point them to this very <i>special</i> place. Without further ado, please enjoy your time here at ObiLeia.</p>
