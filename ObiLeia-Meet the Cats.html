	      <h1>Obi</h1>
	      <p>Meet Obi! Obi is a dick. No, seriously. This three year old menace spends 75% of his time awake digging in the trash, pickpocketing items from purses, scratching furniture, the carpet, and your legs, knocking down god knows what from any and all shelves, or zooming around the
		   house so fast you'd think he was personally trained by Usain Bolt himself. He is a walking disaster. But we adore this little douchebag more than anything. When he is not being a miscreant, he is usually sleeping in his little bed on my desk, begging for those 'oh-so-good' pets, or playing with his stuffed animals.
		   Obi was born in dangerous and unfortunate circumstances and has been raised by myself and Katie since he was only minutes old. It was grueling work keeping this jerk alive through those first few months, but every minute was worth it. His favorite activity is to play football (he is a great reciever)
		   and he likes to eat more food than any cat possibly should. He also loves to give hugs. Whenever you return from being gone, he isn't satisfied until someone picks him up and holds him near your chest so he can hug you. He's our little house panther.</p>

	      <h1>Leia</h1>
	      <p>Meet Leia! Leia actually adopted us in 2015 after she stumbled into my parent's backyard and never left. We finally got her to come inside with the family when a heavy rainstorm began, and since then she has had no desire to go back. Leia is our 'good' cat. She has her moments, but she
		     just wants to be held, pet, and paid attention to at all hours of the day. She is a cuddlebug and will remind you consistently when she is not getting attention - such as the 3AM courtesy 'pet me' calls she provides on a nightly basis. She is also the most dense cat you will ever come across. She's like 
		     a copper log. <i>Oh! look at this sweet cat, lets pick her up and give her attention. JESUS what are you? A cinderblock? I almost just threw my friggin back out.</i> Yeah... She doesn't look thicc, but she's a Snickers, if you know what I'm saying. Leia doesn't play too much, but she does love to attack
		     feet that are under blankets, and she has a particular fish toy that she likes to chase. She is our sweet girl, and we wouldn't be the same without her love.</p>
